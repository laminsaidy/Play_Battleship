# WELCOME TO MY ULTIMATE BATTLESHIPS
Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two or more players. It allows the user to play on ruled grids on which each user's fleet of ships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other user. It allows users to take alternate turns to shoot at each others ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing user's fleet. My  siteâ€™s goal is to provide an easy but challenging game to entertain the Users.

<li>Coordinates outside Grid size are not allowed and previous guesses can't be use twice</li>
<li>The player and computer take guesses trying to sink each others Battleships.</li>

# Testing
I have manually tested the code through my local terminal and the codeinstitute Heroku terminal. <br>
Tested the code through CI Python Linter validator and no errors where found.


# Bugs
There was no symbols on the board game when a player take a shot as intended therefore, I had to rewrite the board function properly to get it fixed.
## Remaining Bugs
There are no Bugs remaining.
## Validator testing
No errors where found on the CI Python Linter validator.

# Deployment
This project was deployed using Codeinstute's mock terminal for Heroku.
## Steps for deployment
Fork or clone this repository. <br>
Create a new Heroku app. <br>
Set the buildbacks to python and NodJS in that order. <br>
Link the Heroku app to the repository. <br>
click on Deploy.
